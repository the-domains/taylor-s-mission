Richard Shuman's first novel comes from years of the adage, "Your first million words will all be practice.  You will practice writing stories - you may even practice selling them - but they will all be practice."  From absorbing wisdom from David Gerrold, in the form of a writing seminar, to classwork led by David Hartwell and Samuel R. Delaney, and a short membership in a writers' group led by Hal Clement, years of practice have led to "Taylor's Mission."  Set less than twenty years in the future, Executive Officer Jim Taylor is forced to balance the needs of a spacecraft hurtling off course while discovering how - and why - a young crewman is dead.
