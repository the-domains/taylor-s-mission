  Richard Shuman's first novel comes from years of the adage, "Your first
  million words will all be practice. You will practice writing stories - you
  may even practice selling them - but they will all be practice." From
  absorbing such wisdom of David Gerrold, in the form of a writing seminar, to
  classwork led by David Hartwell and Samuel R. Delaney, and a short membership
  in a writers' group led by Hal Clement, years of practice have led to
  "Taylor's Mission." Set less than twenty years in the future, Executive
  Officer Jim Taylor is forced to balance the needs of a spacecraft hurtling off
  course while determining how - and why - a young crewman is dead.
